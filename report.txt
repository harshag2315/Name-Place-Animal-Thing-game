#report and discription of NPAT2.py file
This Python program is a word game that involves multiple players. The game starts by asking 
the number of players, and then each player enters their name. The program then displays the 
rules of the game, which include a maximum time limit of 40 seconds for each player, the 
possibility of elimination due to an invalid character, and the rewards for correct and 
incorrect answers.

After displaying the rules, the program selects a random uppercase letter and prompts each 
player to form a name, a place, an animal, and a thing starting with that letter. The program 
then records the time taken by each player to complete their input and checks if the input is 
valid.

The program then calculates the marks for each player based on their input. Each correct answer 
is rewarded with 10 points, while incorrect answers receive 0 points. If a player's animal, name, 
place, or thing does not start with the specified letter or contains an invalid character, that 
answer is considered incorrect.

If a player takes more than 40 seconds to complete their input, their data and name are removed 
from the game. After the marks are calculated, the program displays the input and marks of each 
player and announces the winner or multiple winners.

The program gives the players an option to play again or exit the game.

Imported modules:

time: to measure the time taken by each player
random: to select a random uppercase letter
string: to generate uppercase and lowercase letters
animal_checker: a module containing functions to check if a word is an animal
thing_checker: a module containing functions to check if a word is a thing
country_checker: a module containing functions to check if a word is a place/country

Functions:

is_animal: a function to check if a word is an animal
is_thing: a function to check if a word is a thing
is_place: a function to check if a word is a place/country
The main program uses a while loop to allow players to play multiple times. Within the loop, 
the program asks for the number of players and their names, displays the rules, and prompts 
players to form words starting with a randomly selected uppercase letter. Then, the program 
records the time taken by each player, checks if their input is valid, and calculates their marks.

The program then displays the input and marks of each player and announces the winner or multiple 
winners. The players can choose to play again or exit the game.

The given program uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library in Python to check 
whether the given input string is an animal name or not.

The program starts by importing the necessary module from the NLTK library and downloading 
the WordNet database using the nltk.download('wordnet') function. WordNet is a lexical 
database for the English language that is used for natural language processing tasks.

The program defines a function is_animal(animal) that takes an input string animal as 
its parameter. The function checks if the input string is an animal name by using the 
wordnet.synsets(animal) function, which returns a list of synsets (sets of synonyms) for the 
given word. If the length of the list is greater than 0, the function returns True, 
indicating that the input string is an animal name. Otherwise, the function returns False.

#report and discription of country_checker.py file
The program uses the geopy library to determine if a place exists. It defines a function 
called is_place that takes a string argument representing a place name.

The function creates a Nominatim object from the geopy.geocoders module and sets a user 
agent for the object. The user agent is a string that identifies the user or the application 
that is making the request.

Next, the function tries to geocode the place by calling the geocode method of the Nominatim 
object with the place argument. The geocode method returns a Location object if it is able to 
geocode the place, otherwise it returns None.

Finally, the function checks if the location variable is not None. If it is not None, the 
function returns True, indicating that the place exists. Otherwise, the function returns False, 
indicating that the place does not exist or could not be geocoded.

Note that the Nominatim object sends requests to the OpenStreetMap (OSM) API, which has a usage 
policy that should be respected. The user_agent parameter is used to identify the application 
making the request, and can be set to any string.

#report and discription of thing_checker.py file
The program imports the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) library and downloads the "wordnet" corpus 
from nltk. The "wordnet" corpus is a lexical database for English language, which includes words 
with their definitions, synonyms, antonyms, and other related words.

The program defines a function called "is_thing" that takes an input string as an argument. The 
function uses the "wordnet" corpus to check if the input string is a valid noun or not. The function 
does this by calling the "synsets" method of the "wordnet" corpus with the input string and the part 
of speech (pos) as "NOUN".

If the "synsets" method returns one or more synsets, then the input string is considered a valid noun 
and the function returns True. Otherwise, the function returns False.

The program is useful for tasks that involve identifying nouns in text data, such as text 
classification or natural language processing. The program demonstrates the use of the "wordnet" corpus 
from the nltk library for identifying nouns in text data.
