This is a very interesting game which is widely play in india
This Python program is a word game that involves multiple players. The game starts by asking 
the number of players, and then each player enters their name. The program then displays the 
rules of the game, which include a maximum time limit of 40 seconds for each player, the 
possibility of elimination due to an invalid character, and the rewards for correct and 
incorrect answers.

After displaying the rules, the program selects a random uppercase letter and prompts each 
player to form a name, a place, an animal, and a thing starting with that letter. The program 
then records the time taken by each player to complete their input and checks if the input is 
valid.

The program then calculates the marks for each player based on their input. Each correct answer 
is rewarded with 10 points, while incorrect answers receive 0 points. If a player's animal, name, 
place, or thing does not start with the specified letter or contains an invalid character, that 
answer is considered incorrect.

If a player takes more than 40 seconds to complete their input, their data and name are removed 
from the game. After the marks are calculated, the program displays the input and marks of each 
player and announces the winner or multiple winners.
